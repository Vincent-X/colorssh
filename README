colorssh -- Al Williams al.williams@awce.com

A somewhat silly shell script. The idea is to set colors
in your ssh config so you can have different screen colors
for different hosts.

Usage
1) You need gawk on your path; other awk versions may work
2) Edit ~/.ssh/config. Put all options for given host there
   as you always do for ssh. Also add:
   #FOREGROUND=white
   #BACKGROUND=black
   You can use any of the ANSI colors (white, black, green, blue,
   yellow, purple, cyan, red) you can also use default.
3) Issue ssh hostname -- where hostname is the entry you want in
   .ssh/config. No other arguments are allowed.
4) Things that change the color will not return your colors to the original.
   Consider puting EXPORT TERM=xterm-mono in your startup files on hosts
   you want to use this with.
5) You could alias ssh to colorssh but don't forget that you can't pass any
   options (including user name and password) using colorssh.
